Living easy, living free
Season ticket on a one-way ride
Asking nothing, leave me be
Taking everything in my stride
Dont need reason, dont need rhyme
Aint nothing I'd rather do
Going down, party time
My friends are gonna be there too, yeah

Im on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell
Im on the highway to hell


No stop signs, speed limit
Nobodys gonna slow me down
Like a wheel, gonna spin it
Nobodys gonna mess me round
Hey satan, payed my dues
Playing in a rocking band
Hey momma, look at me
Im on my way to the promised land
OWWW

Im on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
Im on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
Ohhhhh

Don't stop me
Yeah, yeah, owwww

Im on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Im on the highway to hell
On the highway to... HELL
Highway to hell
Im on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
Highway to hell
Highway to hell
Momma, highway to highway to hell

And Im going down, all the way down
Im on the highway to hell
